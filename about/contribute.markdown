## Get Involved

Helping is easy.  You don't even *need* Jekyll installed locally, but it helps.  Changes and pull requests are encouraged.  Want to fix a typo.  Add some info?  Add a page, or more?  *Go for it!*  

### Edit Using Github

1. You need to be a member of the Uncoded Organization on Github.  If you're not a member, ask an [existing owner](https://github.com/orgs/uncodedlb/people) to invite you to the [Uncoded Organization on Github](https://github.com/orgs/uncodedlb).  [:information_source: Help](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization/). This gives you the ability to See all other members, Create teams, Mention teams, See all teams, See all repositories, and Create repositories.
1. Accept the invite per previous step.  Then login to Github.
1. Now, [edit a post](https://github.com/uncodedlb/hacknightlbc.github.io/tree/master/_posts), [layout](https://github.com/uncodedlb/hacknightlbc.github.io/tree/master/_layouts), [css](https://github.com/uncodedlb/hacknightlbc.github.io/tree/master/css) or any other file in [this GIT repo using Github GUI](https://github.com/uncodedlb/hacknightlbc.github.io).

### Not a Member? Use Typical Github Workflow

1. `Fork` the repository: [How to Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
1. Setup Jekyll locally (see [Gemfile](https://github.com/uncodedlb/hacknightlbc.github.io/blob/master/Gemfile) and [Jekyll Docs]())
1. Make changes locall.
1. Optionally, enable Travis for yourself (on your forked) repo: `https://travis-ci.org/profile/**username**`.  [Read more](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/)
1.  Create a `Pull Request` to share:  [How to create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
