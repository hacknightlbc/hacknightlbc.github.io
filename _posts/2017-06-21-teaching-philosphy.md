In an effort to focus on a topic the group has started to develop an open format where we vote on the evening's discussion. Check out the ["Voting Items"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yqw3y4JEhiQTuA5_CSP9mDFIpD-_8WGEmg1248MNaQA){:target="_blank"} 

We use the basic format with the following questions:

- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- What do you want to know?

Keep it up LBHN!
