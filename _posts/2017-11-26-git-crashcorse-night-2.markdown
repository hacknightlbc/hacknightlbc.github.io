After setting up [Git on your local machine](/2017/11/21/git-crashcorse.html) we will start some simple lessions.

### Poems, Not Code

To simplify our jorney into Git we will be using simple poems in the place of code. If you don't already have access to our [poem repository](https://github.com/hacknightlbc/poems) feel free to ask us to get you connected.

`git clone git@github.com:hacknightlbc/poems.git`

Original or public domain poems only, please.
