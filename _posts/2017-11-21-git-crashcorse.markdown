Tonight we'll be covering some basics of using [Git]. Git is a version control system for text and code. Probably the fastest way to dig into Git is by using the online [Git Tutorial]. It's easy and only take 15 minutes.

The second part we'll tackle is installing Git on your local machine.

**For Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux**

_This was designed for Ubuntu based systems._

`sudo apt install git`

**For MacOS Systems**

You can download the Git binaries from the [download] page.

With [Brew] installed you can run:

`brew install git`

We'll try to help everyone get set up. For those playing the home game reach out to me [@arthursucks] or chat with us on the [Slack channel]. We'll do our best to set you up.

**Never hesitate to ask for Help!**  
That's exactly why this community is here.
